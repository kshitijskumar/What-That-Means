# What-That-Means
A dictionary app that extracts words from images and then displays the meaning.
## Overview
The app uses Firebase ML Kit for text extraction from the image. 
The meaning of the word extracted is then retrieved from a REST api using Retrofit.
The app can be used in two ways:
1. Extract text from the image and then get the meaning.
2. Search for the meaning directly using the search bar.

MVVM architecture is used along with Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.
